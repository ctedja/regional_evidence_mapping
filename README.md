# regional_evidence_database
Manipulating multiple datasets to produce a consolidated database of evidence produced across Asia and the Pacific. 
 
This **[code](https://github.com/ctedja/regional_evidence_database/blob/main/Evidence_Backend.R)** works with the **[Reliefweb API](https://apidoc.rwlabs.org/)** and multiple internal databases to collate and classify thousands of different resources. The code is a work in progress, uploaded to track changes. Machine learning methods could still be employed to maximise accuracy of classification; the current approach is still relatively simple.

There are multiple outputs for different audiences, including a mapping tool which enables the investigation of what evidence exists at specific administrative levels, or simple timelines.
